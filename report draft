Shape fitting


After segmentation, a list of face cluster is generated and their principal components are obtained by PCA. PCA will be performed on the set of new objects as well and to compare with each of the face clusters by their euclidean distance. The object with the minimum distance will be fit on the target by translation. New mesh will be generated by adding up all the translated object meshes.


//textures are mapped to the mesh before adding to the main mesh???

Limitations:

Due to performance issues, 
program uses matlab engine to compoute PCA
